WDCountdownFormatter
====================

An NSFormatter that formats NSTimeIntervals into a countdown of the format HH:mm:ss

Inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13609978/ios-formatting-localizing-timers-time-counters

All you need to do, it provide it with an `NSNumber`, that contains an `NSTimeInterval`. This will then provide you with a locale aware string.
More improvements may be made over time.
